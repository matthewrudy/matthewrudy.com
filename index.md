# About Me

My name is Matthew Rudy Jacobs.

我的中文名字是《馬泰》
（別叫我《馬修》）

I'm a british software developer and consultant currently living in Taipei.

I studied Mathematics at Clare College, Cambridge, and in 2006 started working with Ruby and Rails.

In 2010 I moved to Hong Kong, and founded the Hong Kong developer group Codeaholics.

In 2014 I organised the first Hong Kong Code Conf.

## Motivation

### Working with great people

In life we are always learning.
And building great software is a constant journey of new experiences, tools, and approaches.

My working life is only as good as the people I work with.

Great teams build great software, and I want to be part of these great teams.

### Building valued products

Building great software is only 10% about the code.

The design, the interaction, the business proposition is actually what makes a great product.

So let's stop building great software that no one uses.

Let's build products that help people.

And, yes, making new ways to procrastinate is a valid way to help people.

### Empowering developers

In Silicon Valley and Western Europe this isn't so much of a problem.

But in Asia developers are frequently treated as commodities.

Let's change that, and let's start today.
